Initial notes on getting m1n1 set up and installed

My machine is an M1 mini, 2020, with 16GB RAM and 1TB disk. It's fresh out of the box with my user account set up. It is on macOS 12.0.1.

I tried a pre-alpha version of the installer from https://mrcn.st/alxsh dated 2021-11-20.

curl -L https://mrcn.st/alxsh | sh

from macOS, but it said no actions were available.

I then booted into 1TR by shutting the machine off completely, holding the power button until startup options came up, then selecting the "Options" option. I retried the command in the terminal in 1TR, but received the same response.

I launched Disk Utility then selected the option to partition the volume group. I chose to resize the Macintosh HD partition to 500GB, though allegedly only 2-3GB are necessary. Note that unmounting the volume group prevents resizing from being possible. Once the process was complete, a new container called disk6 appeared, with an untitled volume inside. I deleted the volume, then reran the install script.

Now I had options. I chose to "install a macOS stub and m1n1 into an existing APFS container", chose the container I just created, then chose the version of macOS already installed on the machine, 12.0.1. After a few minutes, it told me I had to select the startup disk "None". However, Asahi linux's logo was displayed, so I selected that instead. I hit Restart and entered my password.

After a few seconds, it told me to restart back into 1TR, choose Options, run the terminal again, and execute the command `/Volumes/''/step2.sh`, which does not make much sense. When I rebooted and got back into the terminal, I found a script called step2.sh in /Volumes/Linux\ 1, so I executed it. I entered my username and password as it requested, then rebooted when prompted.

When the system rebooted, the display did not come back up. However, I attached a USB cable to the DFU port and plugged it into a Linux PC and the m1n1 usb tty devices showed up, so everything worked!
