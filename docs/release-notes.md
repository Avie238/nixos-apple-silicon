This release updates to the latest Asahi kernel and other stuff. Currently only
the non-edge config is supported.

Sound is not yet fully supported. Work remains to integrate the ALSA UCM
configurations into NixOS. This will be addressed in the future.

The 4K patch no longer applies so this kernel only operates in 16K mode for now.
This is not planned to be addressed. PRs are welcome for an updated patch.

Due to a change in the device trees, booting old kernels with the latest trees,
i.e. switching to an older generation using the bootloader, may leave you with
broken USB support. Once booted into the generation, you can run
`/run/current-system/bin/switch-to-configuration switch` then reboot to force
the bootloader and the correct version of U-Boot/m1n1/the device trees to be
reinstalled and loaded.

The edge config and a prototype of the GPU driver will be addressed in the
future.
